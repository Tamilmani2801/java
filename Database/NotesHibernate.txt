Hibernate:
----------
    -ORM framework(object relation mapping)
prerequites:
-----------
i)core java
ii)sql
iii)jdbc

Note:
--------
    In case of sql we save data in tables hence we send as value in jdbc but most of times we have datas as object in java so object has to  stored in table for that we use "ORM Tools"
    -some of ORM Tools
        -Hibernate  
        -iBatis
        -Toplink
 

 How can we save the objects in Hibernate ?
    -save(obj)
        -save is done with help of session.
        -session is comes under sessionfactory
        -hence session will done with the help of 
            i)xml
            ii)java based configuration
            iii)annotation

Annotations in hibernate:
--------------------------
@Entity ----------------------used to create a table
@Id  -------------------------used to set primary key
@Table(name="table_name")-----to set table name 
@Columns(name="column_name")--to set column name 
@Transient--------------------hide a column if we dont need in table
                Note:
                -----
                    In case of object there will be several variables if we want to hide a data then we @Tranisent to that variable.
@Embeddable-------------------one class should embedded in another table in class
                Note:
                -----
                    For example ,in a table for name itself there will be firstname, middlename,lastname in order to maintain we will create this 
                    in separate class and we will use as name in another class at that time we have to mention "@Embeddable" in that another class 
                    which contatin firstname ,middlename,lastname.
