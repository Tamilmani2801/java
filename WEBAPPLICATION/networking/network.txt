Network:
---------
        In order to connect via Network we need to use socket at both the end
                i)socketinputstream
                ii)socketoutputstream
->Initially socket only at the client silent and at the server side there will be server socket,
when the client send the request to the server and the request will be accpet by the server socket then socket object will be 
created in the server side then the connection will be establish between them.

How to make connection:
-----------------------

Server side
-------------
->In server side create a server socket object with the port number
        ServerSocket s = new ServerSocket(9999);
->In Socket there is method called "accpet(), give the server socket reference variable to the socket
        Socket soc = s.accpet();
client side
-----------
->In the client side create a Socket object object and give ip address and port number.
        Socket soc = new Socket("localhost",9999);
    ->localhost refers both are on the same machine, if it is in different machine then ip address should provide
